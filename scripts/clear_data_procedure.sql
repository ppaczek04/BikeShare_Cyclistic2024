/*===============================================================
 Procedure: cleaned_data.load_clean_data
 Purpose  : Cleans and transforms raw trip data into a curated form,
            ready for analytics and reporting (CLEANED layer).
 
 Key Cleaning Rules:
   - Remove duplicate ride_ids (keep latest ended_at).
   - Convert timestamps to datetime2, lat/long to decimal.
   - Enforce trip duration (60 sec â€“ 24h).
   - Keep only trips within Chicago coordinates.
   - Standardize categorical fields (rideable_type, member_casual).
   - Derive enrichment columns: ride_seconds, ride_minutes,
     ride_date, weekday_name/num, season, is_roundtrip.

 Index Handling:
   - Nonclustered indexes are dropped before load (faster insert).
   - Recreated after load to support analysis queries.

 Note:
   Cleaned layer guarantees consistent datatypes,
   valid ranges, and enriched attributes for BI tools.
